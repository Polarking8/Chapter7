//In the 17th century, the discipline of probability theory got its start
//when a gambler asked a mathematician friend to explain some observations about dice games.
// Why did he, on average, lose a bet that at least one six would appear when rolling a die four times?
// And why did he seem to win a similar bet, getting at least one double-six when rolling a pair of dice 24 times?
//Nowadays, it seems astounding that any person would roll a pair of dice 24 times in a row,
// and then repeat that many times over. Letâ€™s do that experiment on a computer instead.
// Simulate each game a million times and print out the wins and losses, assuming each bet was for $1.
//Create a Tester class which performs the input/output with the console.
//Create a business logic class for the game.
//Be sure you are not performing I/O in your business logic.  Add Javadoc and a UML diagram.
//UML MUST be added to your project.  it will be marked as missing if it is included in a secondary link like Google Docs.
// Export and include your diagrams in your repo in GitHub.
