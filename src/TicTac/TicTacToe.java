//Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe. The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid and is played by two players,
// who take turns. The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross.
// The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins.
// Your program should draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark,
// change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.
//Separate your business logic from your I/O.
//Include a junit test, UML and a flow chart.
//All diagrams must be included in the repo.  They will be counted as missing if they are submitted via a link.
